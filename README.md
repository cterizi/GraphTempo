# GraphTempo: Exploring the History of Temporal Graphs

The GraphTempo project will offer a general framework for the exploration of the full history of a graph through time including its structure (vertices and edges) and content (e.g., labels, properties, weights) associated with this structure. The framework will offer a declarative approach to temporal graph processing consisting of a set of novel exploration queries. Furthermore, it will reveal hidden properties of real-world networks through the application of the framework, and will improve the evolution of networks by proposing novel link recommendation algorithms.
