Insights: 
1) They propose a dynamic indexing scheme for queries on the last snapshot.
2) They designed another dynamic indexing scheme that can also answer two kinds of historical queries with regard to not only the latest snapshot but also previous snapshots.
3) The methods can construct indices from large graphs with millions of vertices, answer queries in microseconds, and update indices in milliseconds.
4) Experiments on real and synthetic evolving networks.

Type of queries: 1. shortest path between two vertices, 2. distance between two vertices (indicates the closeness of the two users)

They assume the following two scenarios: 1. ask only contemporary queries: last snapshot
										 2. ask historical queries: previous snapshots

Assumptions: undirected unweighted graphs and consider only distance queries but supporting directed and/or weighted graphs and shortest-path queries is discussed. Also, when we assume a dynamic graph, we ignore removals (widely used). The newly inserted vertex is isolated. They choose vertices by the decreasing order of degrees.

Problem definition: 
	Problem 1 (Contemporary Distance Query):
	Given: Two query vertices s, t.
	Answer: Distance d τ (s, t), where τ is the last time when a vertex or an edge is added.

	Problem 2 (Historical Snapshot Distance Query):
	Given: Two query vertices s, t and time τ .
	Answer: Distance d τ (s, t).

	Problem 3 (Historical Distance Change-point Query):
	Given: Two query vertices s, t.
	Answer: Set C(s, t) = {(τ 1 , δ 1 ), (τ 2 , δ 2 ), . . .} where (τ i , δ i ) ∈ C(s, t) if and only if δ i = d τ i (s, t) 6 = d τ i −1 (s, t).

Contemporary Distance Query: The idea behind an efficient update algorithm is to carefully resume and stop pruned BFSs. They only add new label entries or rewrite distances of existing label entries. (Lemma 4.2) -> If the distance from vertex v k to vertex u has changed, then all the new shortest paths between them pass through the new edge (a, b). 
Update Algorithm for Pruned Labeling: PrefixalQuery(s, t, M, k) = min {δ s + δ t | (v i , δ s ) ∈ M (s), (v i , δ t ) ∈ M (t), i ≤ k} the answer to the query between vertices s and t computed from the index M only using distances to vertices whose IDs are at most k.

Historical Distance Query: They start from an algorithm based on dynamic programming, next they turn the algorithm into a BFS-like algorithm, and then introduce pruning to the algorithm. 

To efficiently answer not only distance but also the shortest path, they store parents of label entries in BFS trees, and ascend the trees from the two end points to restore the path.
